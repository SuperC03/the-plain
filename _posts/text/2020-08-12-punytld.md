According to [Wikipedia](Wikipedia)

> Punycode is a representation of Unicode with the limited ASCII character subset used for Internet hostnames. Using Punycode, host names containing Unicode characters are transcoded to a subset of ASCII consisting of letters, digits, and hyphens, which is called the Letter-Digit-Hyphen (LDH) subset. For example, München (German name for Munich) is encoded as Mnchen-3ya.

Domains using this punycode system start with xn-- and is the only way for domains to include characters that are not A-z, 0-9 or a hyphen (-). For example the TLD "商城." becomes "xn--czru2d." when converted to Punycode.

Recently I filed a Centralized Zone Data Service request for the zonefiles for all Top Level Domains (TLDs) that used punycode.
I got access to a total of 71 zonefiles for various xn-- TLDs.
Using these zonefiles I am able to find out the names of all Second Level Domains (SLDs) for each TLD.

The first bit of data I collected was the breakdown of what character sets the TLDs I had collected were using.
Below is a doughnut chart showing the distribution.

As you can see, the majority of punycode based TLDs are using Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.
In Unicode these are all mixed into one category of CJK.
Note that while it is a lot it is barely over half, looking at this next graph we can see the most common character sets for TLDs of all of the 168 thousand SLDs that were in the zonefiles.

This graph tells a completely different story than the last.
It shows that punycode based domains are mostly if not all CJK, with 90.4% being CJK, 2.3% being Katahana (a Japanese script not included in the CJK block in Unicode), and 1.1% being Hiragana (another japanese script).
This means that out of all of the SLDs that use punycode TLDs 94% use a TLD with CJK, Katahana, or Hiragana.
This is despite the fact that only 65% of TLDs are CJK, Katahana, or Hiragana.
Another notable point is that Arabic TLDs while making up 14.5% of TLDs are only used on 0.5% of SLDs with punycode TLDs.

Looking at the chart of the most common punycode TLDs shows a similar story.
<canvas class="chart" id="topTLDs"></canvas>
All of the top 10 punycode TLDs are CJK, Katahana, which makes sense considering their previously mentioned 94% monopoly over punycode TLD usage.
Next I decided to look at the character used in SLDs.

As with the previous examples CJK makes up a vast majority, but this time latin is the next most common.
This makes sense because there were a considerable amount of company domains registered as well as these weird spam domains that looked like "08k43vbgek4cq6458pvi1c1o7l0q9ghb".
I was not able to find the source or the point of those seemingly spam domains with lots of them also returning NXDOMAIN when I queried the nameservers directly instead of just reading the zonefiles I was given.
Interstingly 1.3% of the SLDs were just or mostly numbers, while it is low it still felt rather high considering most of these domains, 124,577 out of 167,417 or just about 75%, were punycode xn-- SLDs.

Below is a graph showing how many SLDs had the same character set as their TLD.
<canvas class="chart" id="characterSetCountWhereSLDMatchesTLD"></canvas>
Like previous graphs it pretty much just shows CJK with a slight hint of Hangul. This is once again due to the high usage of CJK TLDs in comparison with others which has really been the main thing demostrated. CJK based TLDs in comparison with other character sets are the most adopted.
