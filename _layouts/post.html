		Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her. If you could <a href="https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/RayofHopeMedicalMissionsInc/Jaden">please donate to her memorial fund</a>. All the proceeds will go to the <a href="https://www.rohmm.org/">Ray of Hope Medical Missions</a> which facilitates life-changing surgeries, reduces infant mortality, and provides mission opportunities locally.
